            I'm a common man... a man of time!" — this phrase carries a quiet
            power, suggesting someone grounded in everyday life yet deeply aware
            of the passage and weight of time. The speaker isn't claiming
            greatness or grandeur, but rather a connection to the rhythms of
            existence that shape all people. He walks among the ordinary, yet
            his thoughts stretch across decades, memories, and futures. His
            identity is not built on status, but on his relationship with time —
            how it moves through him, how he moves through it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To be a "man of time" is to live with an acute awareness of change.
            It means carrying the past like a worn coat, stitched with lessons
            and regrets, while facing the future with a gaze sharpened by
            experience. This man sees time not as a clock ticking, but as a
            force that molds character, reveals truth, and tests resilience. He
            may not be famous, but he is rich in moments — the kind that shape a
            soul. His strength lies in his ability to endure, to adapt, and to
            reflect
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And yet, being a common man doesn't mean being forgettable. It means
            being relatable, present, and real. He is the neighbor who nods at
            sunrise, the worker who knows the value of a minute, the father who
            marks years by his children's laughter. Time is his companion,
            sometimes cruel, sometimes kind. But always, it is his measure — of
            love, of loss, of legacy. In claiming this identity, he honors the
            quiet dignity of living fully, moment by moment.
